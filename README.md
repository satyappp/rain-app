# Rain App (傘通知アプリ）
## Description
A react native application that aims to reduce the misplacements and forgetting of umbrellas during rainy days.
It is programmed to send a notification to remind the user to take their umbrellas once they have moved from a location where they have been staying for a threshold amount of time.
The app is created using React Native, JavaScript, and Expo.
Currently available on both iOS and Android OS but location-based notification is available only on Android OS.
